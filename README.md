Analysis of petitions.gov data on petition to conduct a second EU referendum

This is a R script to download the latest petition data (JSON format) from petitions.gov and track which constituencies are signing it the most. 

Later on I will try and do some geo stuff, this is just a very first pass.

Feel free to pull request if you want to add more analysis!
